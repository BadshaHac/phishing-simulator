## Example of Simulation

When you open the simulation, you might see a **fake email** like this:

**Subject**: "Important! Your Account Has Been Suspended"
**Message**: "We noticed unusual activity on your account. Click here to verify your identity: [link]"

**Red Flag**: The URL might look like `www.gmaill-support.com`, which is **slightly** different from the legitimate "gmail.com". That's a **typical phishing tactic**!

That's all! This simulator will help you recognize and avoid real phishing attempts in your inbox and online accounts. Stay safe!
